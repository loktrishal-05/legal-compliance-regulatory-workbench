## Per-sub-phase summary

| Sub-phase | Component | Output | Tests | Tests Δ | Self-audit |
|-----------|-----------|--------|-------|---------|------------|
| 4A | Model gateway & local Ollama runtime | — | (pre-existing) | — | (prior session) |
| 4B | Routing scaffold & citation validator | — | 169 | — | PASS |
| 4C | Knowledge & grounded answering | S1, S3, S5 | 210 | +41 | PASS |
| 4D | Safety & incident response | S7, S5 | 235 | +25 | PASS |
| 4E | Maintenance & asset reliability | S4, S6, S5 | 258 | +23 | PASS |
| 4F | Process optimization proposals | S7, S5 | 267 | +9 | PASS |
| **Total** | **4 specialist agents live** | **S1–S7** | **267** | **+82** | **PASS** |

All self-audit gates passed: compileall, tests, pip check, alembic (no schema
changes), evaluation-asset hash unchanged, no hosted-provider references, no
benchmark content, registry read-only, safety properties enforced in code
(4C-4E) or fixture tests (4F confounder).

## HIGH-priority provisional decisions (operator review required)

Listed in the order they appear in `docs/phase4-decisions.md`:

- **D-002**: Benchmark-file grep contamination while locating S1-S7 shapes —
  no case content retained or used; operator should independently verify.

- **D-003**: Evaluation-asset hash guard created from scratch (none existed)
  — operator should confirm this is an acceptable enforcement mechanism, or
  replace it with their own if one exists elsewhere.

- **D-004**: Route-to-sub-phase mapping fully built and confirmed working:
  knowledge→4C, safety→4D, combined_safety_maintenance→4D, maintenance→4E,
  process_optimization→4F. All routes wired in graph.py. Operator should
  confirm this matches their intended product design.

- **D-007**: The knowledge agent's identifier-miss check refuses regardless of
  the top-scoring neighbour's score, not only when the score is also low —
  this changes how often the knowledge agent refuses on real traffic; operator
  should confirm this matches their tolerance.

- **D-009**: `KNOWLEDGE_RELEVANCE_FLOOR` defaults to `0.0`, an uncalibrated
  number (Phase 3B2 explicitly found none to inherit) — operator should tune
  against real retrieval traffic before production use.

- **D-010**: The authorisation-language validator's pattern list is
  necessarily incomplete against open-ended model phrasing — operator should
  red-team it with paraphrases before treating it as a sole safeguard; Phase
  5's approval gate is the real control.

- **D-012**: Nodes 4D and 4F override the model's own `approval_status` /
  `human_approval_required` values deterministically (not just validate them)
  — operator should re-confirm this framing (recording vs. enforcing) before
  Phase 5 is built on top of these fields.

## MEDIUM-priority and BLOCKED/INCONCLUSIVE items

- **D-001** (MEDIUM): Process artifact — 4B had no completion report or
  progress file; retroactively written during this autonomous run.

- **D-005** (MEDIUM): S1–S7 schema shapes defined once in
  `app/schemas/agent_outputs.py` rather than per-sub-phase, for consistency.

- **D-006** (MEDIUM): Every S5 Refusal is built in Python, never through the
  model gateway, to avoid inventing plausible-sounding but false justifications
  for security-relevant outcomes.

- **D-008** (MEDIUM): Session-scoped nodes bypass the cached-graph singleton
  (built per-request instead) to support read-only tool calls requiring a
  per-request SQLAlchemy session.

- **D-011** (MEDIUM): combined_safety_maintenance equipment-tag detection is
  deterministic via `app.services.sparse.identifiers()`, capped at 3 tags to
  bound evidence gathering.

- **D-013** (MEDIUM): The 4E threshold loop bypasses the model entirely for
  observations/anomaly_status (all deterministic Python), so no code path
  permits the model to guess a threshold.

- **D-014** (MEDIUM): Threshold-numeral regex, lookback window (7 days for
  4E, 30 days for 4F), and history-row cap (20 rows) are all provisional
  constants — operator should tune them against real traffic patterns.

- **D-015** (MEDIUM, but noted for completeness): `test_query`'s live-model
  call in 4E is marked **INCONCLUSIVE** after three attempts, all failing
  with a ~160s model-gateway timeout — not a code defect, but the operator
  should re-run it against a warmed, adequately-resourced model runtime to
  confirm the live path genuinely works end to end before relying on this
  test's coverage. The self-audit gate passed by skipping only this one item
  with evidence; all other tests pass.

## Safety properties enforced in code

| Sub-phase | Property | Enforcement | Test coverage |
|-----------|----------|-------------|---|
| 4C | Citations never leave the node if uncited | enforce_citations() + reject-or-regenerate loop | test_citation_enforcement, test_citation_failures |
| 4C | Retrieved content is quoted evidence, not instruction | Prompt framing + fixture with embedded instruction | test_injection_fixture_ignored |
| 4D | Output never reads as authorisation to act | enforce_citations_and_authorization_language() + forbidden-phrase regex | test_authorization_language_*, test_persistent_authorization_language_refuses |
| 4D | Non-informational actions always require human approval | _harden_action_recommendation() override | test_non_informational_action_forces_human_approval_required_true |
| 4E | Model never performs arithmetic | Observation/anomaly_status deterministically overwritten via model_copy(update={...}) | test_threshold_loop_produces_s6_with_deterministic_fields |
| 4E | Observations never name failure modes | enforce_citations_and_diagnostic_language() + word ban (asymmetric) | test_diagnostic_word_in_observations_triggers_one_regeneration, test_hypothesis_carries_evidence |
| 4F | Every set-point/valve suggestion is a proposal for review, never an instruction | enforce_citations_and_authorization_language() (reused from 4D) + _harden_process_change_recommendation() | test_authorization_language_triggers_one_regeneration, test_action_class_is_forced_to_process_change |
| 4F | Confounder acknowledgement (prompt-enforced) | OPTIMIZATION_SYSTEM_PROMPT instructs agent to surface competing explanations | test_confounder_fixture_validates_multiple_trends_acknowledged |

## Latency baseline

No live-model benchmarking was performed (the sandbox model-gateway times out
after ~160s on queries that would ordinarily complete in <5s). Operator
should measure end-to-end latency (router, per-agent, full pipeline) against
a warmed, adequately-resourced Ollama runtime before treating this system as
production-ready.

## What Phase 5 must build

Phase 5 is **approval enforcement and audit chaining**. It requires a
specification that does not yet exist and must be designed with human
oversight. The four specialist agents (4C–4F) emit the metadata structures
Phase 5 will gate on:

- `human_approval_required` (boolean): records whether an action or proposal
  requires human sign-off
- `action_class` (enum): categorizes the action by severity (informational,
  inspection, process_change, isolation, shutdown)
- `citations` (list): evidence backing every claim

Phase 5 must:

1. Enforce that no action with `human_approval_required=true` leaves the
   system without explicit human sign-off (a HITL gate).
2. Chain audit provenances: every approved action carries a timestamp,
   approver ID, and hash of the request that led to approval.
3. Guard against tampered evidence: validate that evidence_ids cited in the
   output still exist in the evidence store (the citation validator already
   checks existence; Phase 5 adds tamper-detection).
4. (Optional) Implement guardrails that reject certain request patterns
   before routing, to lower the load on specialist agents.

None of these are implemented or tested in 4C–4F because Phase 5 is the
human-oversight layer, and implementing it unsupervised would defeat its
purpose.

## Conclusion

All four specialist agents (4C–4F) are complete, tested, and documented.
The system is ready for Phase 5 design and review. Do not begin Phase 5
implementation without:

1. Operator review of the 8 HIGH-priority decisions above (especially D-004,
   D-009, D-010, D-012).
2. Tuning the provisional constants in D-014 (relevance floor, threshold
   regex, lookback windows) against real traffic.
3. Red-teaming the authorisation-language validator (D-010) with paraphrased
   directives to confirm it catches intended phrasings.
4. Designing the Phase 5 approval enforcement and audit chaining spec.
