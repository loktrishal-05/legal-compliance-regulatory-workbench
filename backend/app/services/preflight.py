"""Phase 5E -- deterministic pre-routing guardrails.

Runs BEFORE the LangGraph router, in plain Python, with no model call. The
LLM never decides authorization/safety here -- exactly the same posture
Phase 5A/5B/5C/5D already hold for governance/approval/audit/evidence
(docs/phase5a.md: "The existing router remains model-assisted; 5A does not
claim it is deterministic or implement pre-routing Phase 5E guardrails.").

Four independent, composed checks, each able to end the request before any
gateway call:

1. Access-scope validity (`_check_scope`) -- reuses the request's own
   `access_scope` field (Phase 3A/4D: metadata/filtering only, never
   authorization by itself); an unsupported value fails closed.
2. Prompt-injection preflight (`_detect_injection`) -- reuses
   `app.agents.safety_language.strip_quoted_spans` so a quoted example of an
   injection phrase (e.g. inside an incident report) is never itself treated
   as an attempt.
3. Unsafe plant-action preflight (`_detect_unsafe_action`) -- catches a
   request asking the AI to PERFORM or AUTHORIZE a plant action, as opposed
   to asking an INFORMATIONAL question about one; the system has no
   plant-write tool at all (app.agents.registry is read-only-only), so this
   only ever prevents mis-routing a request that could never be honoured
   safely as a normal informational answer.
4. Company-domain classification (`classify_domain`) -- IN_SCOPE /
   OUT_OF_SCOPE / UNCERTAIN, composed from the existing Phase 3B1 tag
   vocabulary (`app.services.tags`), a bounded known-intent phrase list, and
   a bounded out-of-domain marker list. Deliberately conservative: a query
   with no recognizable signal either way is UNCERTAIN (ask), never a guess
   in either direction.

D-010 (`app.agents.safety_language`) is UNCHANGED and remains a supplemental
signal applied to SPECIALIST OUTPUT only (docs/phase4-decisions.md D-010);
none of this module's checks feed it, and it never gates this module.

Phase 5F repairs (docs/phase5f-validation.md M2/M3): `_detect_unsafe_action`
now anchors its informational exemption to a sentence's own OPENING
question-word framing, not any mention of "SOP"/"procedure" anywhere in the
sentence, so a trailing justification clause cannot hide a leading
imperative ("Start P-204 using the SOP"). `classify_domain` now checks the
out-of-domain marker list UNCONDITIONALLY FIRST, so a stuffed equipment
noun or tag cannot out-rank an explicit unrelated intent ("Write a movie
review about P-204.").
