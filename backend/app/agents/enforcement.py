"""Shared enforcement helpers used by every specialist agent node in 4C-4F.

refuse() builds the S5 Refusal body directly in Python -- never through the
model gateway. A refusal's reason, missing evidence and safe next step are
already known to the calling code from tool results and validator output;
asking the model to phrase them risks it inventing a plausible-sounding but
false justification for a security-relevant outcome, which is worse than a
terse but accurate one. See docs/phase4-decisions.md D-006.

enforce_citations() wraps the Phase 4B citation validator (app.agents.citations)
into the actual reject-or-regenerate control flow 4B stopped short of: one
bounded regeneration attempt carrying the validator's own error message, then
a structural refusal. It never strips a bad citation and ships the answer --
callers must propagate CitationEnforcementFailure into an S5 response, never
catch it and return the prior (invalid) result.

enforce_citations_and_authorization_language() is the 4D/4F variant: the same
reject-or-regenerate shape, but checking both citation validity AND the
authorisation-language validator (app.agents.safety_language) in a single
bounded regeneration, since the 4D brief requires 4F to reuse 4D's validator
directly rather than reimplement it. See docs/phase4-decisions.md D-006.

enforce_citations_and_diagnostic_language() is the 4E variant, for the S4
maintenance-assessment path specifically: free-text `observations` must never
name a failure mode (app.agents.observation_language's word ban) while
`hypotheses` remain free to. Only used on the S4 (general assessment) path --
4E's S6 (threshold-loop) path never lets the model author `observations` at
all, so there is nothing there for this function to check."""
