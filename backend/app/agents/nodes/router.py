"""The classification node.

Deterministic fallback lives in CODE here, never in the prompt: a
StructuredOutputError, or a confidence below AGENT_ROUTER_MIN_CONFIDENCE,
routes to the clarification terminal — never to a default agent. A misrouted
query answered confidently by the wrong specialist is worse than an honest
"I need clarification"."""
