"""WorkbenchState: the LangGraph state contract. A TypedDict (LangGraph
requires this, not a Pydantic model), but every value placed into it is
either a validated Pydantic instance or a primitive.

Accumulating fields use Annotated[list[X], operator.add] reducers. Without a
reducer, a node returning {"warnings": [...]} would silently REPLACE prior
warnings instead of appending — exactly how an early safety warning could
vanish before the response is assembled.

State carries EvidenceRef objects, not raw document text beyond what a
variant already stores (e.g. a chunk's own quote). No node accumulates a
second copy of retrieved text into a separate field.

human_approval_required and action_class are recorded fields, written by
nothing in Phase 4B. Phase 5 enforces them; this phase does not build a gate.

step_records is additive beyond the prompt's minimum field list: it is what
makes per-node timings/usage traceable (see tracing.py) even though
tool_invocations is legitimately always empty in Phase 4B (stub nodes never
call a tool)."""
