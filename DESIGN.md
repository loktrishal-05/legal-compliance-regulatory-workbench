# Design System: Legal & Regulatory Assurance Platform

## Overview

**Phase C direction: "Evidence first, capability status explicit"**

User-approved identity adaptation, not a full redesign: preserve existing layout, palette, fonts and generic motion. Public landing/auth remain dark navy with restrained cyan/teal signals and Archivo; active branding is the authored neutral LRA development mark/wordmark. Original industrial logos, screenshots and footage remain archived unchanged. Sign-in uses a neutral static background; media/motion infrastructure stays preserved for future approved assets. Legal workflows are explicitly not yet available; no legacy benchmark figures are marketed as legal acceptance.

Past login, the `/app` workbench keeps off-white fields, white work surfaces, navy/slate ink and restrained blue actions. It is built for sustained evidence review. Existing industrial screens are labelled legacy regression views, and a persistent migration notice prevents their counts from being mistaken for legal compliance. Density, responsive shell, keyboard focus and user improvements are retained; domain screen replacement is Phase K.

The registers share one token file, the same spacing and radius scales, the same UI sans, and the same semantic roles (agent, human review, knowledge, ok, danger). Only the values flip. Surfaces pick a register with `data-theme`: landing and auth pin `dark`, and the workbench defaults to `light` (operators can switch it to dark).

**Key Characteristics:**
- Two registers split at the login: cinematic dark for Persuade, calm light for Operate.
- Instrument light: cyan marks signal (spine, active stations, runtime boundary, focus), never fills.
- Archivo expanded appears only on landing and auth. The workbench speaks in its UI sans.
- White pill buttons on the night side; blue 10px-radius buttons on the day side.
- Semantic colour is fixed: blue for agent and action, amber for human review, green only for verified or healthy, red only for errors.
- Honest state is a visual element: empty, loading, planned and stale each have a stated form.

## Colors

The palette is a navy night with cyan instrument light on the public side and a cool off-white daylight with a single blue accent in the workbench. Semantic roles carry across both.

### Primary
- **Brand Navy** (`brand-navy`): the landing and auth field, sampled from the approved brand boards so logo crops blend in. In the workbench it survives only as the badge behind the white wordmark in the top bar.
- **Instrument Cyan** (`instrument-cyan`): night-side signal: the scroll spine, section markers, workflow stations, runtime boundary and auth focus. **Instrument Cyan Soft** (`instrument-cyan-soft`) is its text form for the hero and section labels. Legacy OCR styles remain available for source-review adaptation.
- **Workbench Blue** (`workbench-blue`): the one day-side accent. It marks primary buttons, the active nav item, the current view in segmented controls, card links, the selected work order, open-work bars, and focus rings.

### Secondary
- **Signal White** (`signal-white`) on **CTA Ink** (`cta-ink`): the night-side primary button. It goes to pure white on hover. It is quiet because it is achromatic, and the cyan stays reserved for signal.
- **Workbench Teal** (`workbench-teal`): day-side secondary accent for inspection-type work orders and plain links. Chosen for AA on every light surface.

### Tertiary (semantic roles, both registers)
- **Review Amber** (`review-amber` day, `night-review-amber` night): human attention. Used for items awaiting review, H3 transcript flags, thresholds, the "planned" badge, corrective work orders, disclaimers and disabled-capability notices.
- **Verified Green** (`verified-green`): verified, healthy or confirmed state only, such as connected signal dots, ok status chips, checked flags and decision acknowledgements. The night side also has **Flow Green** (`night-flow-green`), which appears only at the far end of the workflow progress gradient and in hash codes in the audit chain.
- **Error Red** (`error-red` day, `night-danger` night): errors, invalid fields and reject actions only.
- **Knowledge Violet** (`knowledge-violet`, `night-knowledge-violet`): knowledge/evidence category; never proof of accepted legal status.
- **Stale Grey** (`stale-grey`): unknown or stale state dots.

### Neutral
- **Night surfaces** (`night-surface-0` to `night-surface-3`): tonal steps above the navy. Landing cards use translucent night-surface-1 (`rgba(4, 19, 41, 0.75–0.9)`) so the grid and particles read through.
- **Night text** (`night-text`, `night-text-muted`, `night-text-faint`): body, supporting copy and captions on the dark side. **Nameplate White** (`nameplate-white`) is used only for Archivo headlines.
- **Daylight Field** (`daylight-field`): the workbench page background. **Daylight Surface** (`daylight-surface`) is the card, panel, nav and top bar surface. `daylight-surface-2` is used for nested wells, hover rows and kanban columns, and `daylight-surface-3` for tracks, segmented-control beds and default buttons.
- **Daylight ink** (`daylight-ink`, `daylight-ink-muted`, `daylight-ink-faint`): navy-slate text. Faint ink is kept at AA on the field.
- **Lines** (`night-line`/`-strong`, `daylight-line`/`-strong`): 1px hairlines are the main structural device in both registers.
- **Chart series** (`chart-1` to `chart-4`): blue, teal, violet and amber, in that order. Night-side equivalents: `#60a5fa`, `#2dd4bf`, `#a78bfa`, `#fbbf24`.

### Named Rules
**The Register Rule.** Landing and auth are always `data-theme="dark"`. The `/app` work surfaces default to light. Owner decision (2026-10-10): `/app` stays on the light register; enhancement, not darkness. Allowed polish: Archivo page titles and KPI numerals, a light report canvas for the legal dashboard (cross-highlight + drill-through, focus mode, per-visual data tables), and a light assistant panel with the research-assistant avatar. No dark frames, WebGL or footage inside `/app`.

**The Signal-Not-Decoration Rule.** Cyan on the night side marks something live, active or bounded: a line, a stroke, a focus ring, a highlighted phrase. It never fills a large area or a button.

**The One-Meaning Rule.** In the workbench, green means verified or healthy, amber means a human must look, and red means error. Workbench Blue marks action and selection and never stands in for status.

## Typography

**Display Font:** Archivo variable (self-hosted, SIL OFL; width axis 62–125%), with Segoe UI Variable Display and system-ui fallbacks.
**Body Font:** Inter, then Segoe UI Variable Text and system-ui, with Nirmala UI and Noto Sans Devanagari/Tamil so Hindi and Tamil render natively offline.
**Label/Mono Font:** JetBrains Mono, then Cascadia Code and Consolas.

**Character:** Retain Archivo display styling on public surfaces; the workbench uses the existing neutral UI sans and tabular numerals. Monospace is for machine facts, hashes and identifiers, not legal body text. The full product name remains accessible; narrow headers may display the neutral LRA mark.

### Hierarchy
- **Display** (Archivo 700, wdth 112, `clamp(3rem, 5.6vw, 5.5rem)`, 0.98): the landing hero headline only. It is split into masked lines, and the key phrase is set in Instrument Cyan Soft.
- **Auth Title** (Archivo 700, wdth 110, `clamp(2.5rem, 4.4vw, 4.4rem)`, 1.02): the story line on each auth route.
- **Headline Brand** (Archivo 700, wdth 108, `clamp(1.9rem, 3.2vw, 2.6rem)`, 1.05, balanced wrap): landing section headings.
- **Ghost wordmark** (retained display styling, outline-only 1px at 16% opacity): "LRA" behind the neutral hero mark, masked away from the copy column.
- **Headline** (UI stack 700, `clamp(1.9rem, 3.2vw, 2.6rem)`, 1.1): workbench page titles.
- **Title** (700, 1.125rem): workbench card and panel titles. Review panes step up to 1.75rem at -0.02em.
- **Body** (400, 1rem, 1.6): running text. Page descriptions are capped at 72ch and landing story copy at 640px.
- **Data** (700, 1.375–1.75rem, tabular numerals): counts and metric values, set beside a plain-language unit ("1 draft awaits human review").
- **Label** (700, 0.75rem, 0.08–0.12em tracking, uppercase): sidebar group names, metric labels, and evidence-type labels (Observation / Hypothesis / Verify). Labels always name the content they sit on.
- **Mono** (700, 11–14px): source identifiers, meaningful workflow steps and illustrative hash-chain labels.

### Named Rules
**The Nameplate Rule.** Archivo is for the night side only, always bold and stretched. The workbench never uses it.

**The Tabular Rule.** Every live number in the workbench uses tabular numerals so values do not jitter on refresh.

## Layout

**Night side.** Retain existing responsive public layouts: hero copy beside the neutral mark, two-column story sections that stack below 1024px, spine/header navigation hidden below 760px, and auth story plus 440px form in the existing frame. Source/workflow illustrations are explicitly planned relationships; the old industrial dashboard capture is not active proof. Mobile headers use the compact mark and preserve accessible product names. Auth forms retain a neutral static background.

**Day side.** The shell is a 264px sticky sidebar plus a 64px sticky blurred top bar. Main padding is 2rem block and `clamp(1rem, 3vw, 3rem)` inline. The dashboard is a 3-column grid (2 at 1280px, 1 at 760px) with 1.5rem gaps and `span-2` feature cards. It opens with a single signals strip (one sentence of status, divided by hairlines), not a wall of tiles. Work surfaces use a list-plus-inspector split (kanban with a 340px sticky inspector, review desk with a 300px sticky queue), which collapses to one column at 1100–1180px. The sidebar becomes a drawer below 1024px. Wide tables scroll inside their card, never the page. Form inputs cap at 40rem.

Spacing follows the 4px-based `spacing` scale in both registers.

## Elevation & Depth

**Night side.** Retain generic atmosphere, particle and surface depth without industrial symbolism or footage claims. The neutral sign-in surface uses the existing legible form treatment. Shadows, focus and motion remain incumbent styling; this identity phase does not introduce new effects or libraries.

**Day side.** Surfaces are hairline-bordered and lifted only slightly. Cards rest on `shadow-1` and rise to `shadow-2` on hover. Floating layers (menus, drawer, sticky decision bar) use `shadow-3`, and the command palette uses its own deeper drop over a lightly blurred backdrop.

### Shadow Vocabulary
- **Rest** (`0 1px 2px rgba(15, 35, 65, 0.06)`): cards, panels, signals strip, work-order cards.
- **Lift** (`0 8px 24px rgba(15, 35, 65, 0.08)`): card hover, chart tooltip, open inspector.
- **Float** (`0 18px 48px rgba(15, 35, 65, 0.14)`): menus, mobile nav drawer, sticky decision bar.
- **Selection halo** (`0 0 0 3px` at 18% of the accent): selected work order, healthy signal dot.

### Named Rules
**The Light-Is-Depth Rule.** On the night side, depth comes from light sources and translucency. On the day side it comes from hairlines and three soft shadows. Neither side uses hard offset shadows.

## Shapes

Corners retain the existing scale. Hairlines define surfaces; dashed borders/labels mark planned or uncertain content. The runtime diagram is a target topology, not a deployment attestation. Status colors never stand in for legal approval or a compliance score.

**The Dashed-Means-Provisional Rule.** A dashed border or stroke signals planned, empty, hypothetical or a boundary. Never use it as decoration.

## Components

### Buttons
- **Shape:** 10px radius in the workbench (`rounded.md`); full pill on landing CTAs; 12px on the full-width auth submit.
- **Night primary:** Signal White on CTA Ink, 50px tall, `0 2rem` padding. Goes to pure white on hover.
- **Night ghost:** transparent with a 22% white border that strengthens to 50% on hover.
- **Workbench primary:** Workbench Blue with white text, 40px tall. On hover it mixes 14% toward the ink colour.
- **Workbench default:** surface-3 bed with a strong hairline. The border turns teal on hover.
- **Danger:** white surface, red text and a 45% red border, with a light red wash on hover. Decision buttons are at least 150×44px.
- **Press:** `scale(0.98)` at 120ms, with no bounce. Focus is always a 3px outline in the register's focus colour, offset 3px.

### Chips
- **Status chip:** pill, 12px bold, a currentColor dot before the text, and a tinted fill (ok green 11%, warn amber 12%, bad red 10% over white).
- **Series chip:** pill toggle with a colour key. When pressed off it drops to 60% opacity and the key becomes an outline.
- **Top-bar pills:** a status dot plus a short fact ("Backend connected", "0 hosted AI calls").

### Cards / Containers
- **Corner Style:** 16px (`rounded.lg`) for panels, route cards and kanban columns.
- **Background:** Daylight Surface on the field. Nested wells use surface-2.
- **Shadow Strategy:** Rest, then Lift on hover (see Elevation).
- **Border:** 1px `daylight-line`.
- **Internal Padding:** 1.5rem for cards and panels, 1rem for nested cards, 2rem for the review pane.

### Inputs / Fields
- **Workbench:** 42px, white, strong hairline, 10px radius. Invalid fields get a red border. Disabled fields drop to 55% opacity.
- **Auth:** 46px, `rgba(1, 8, 20, 0.6)`, cyan-tinted hairline, 12px radius. Focus sets the border to `#5ad8e8` with a 4px cyan halo at 18%.

### Navigation
- **Workbench sidebar:** grouped (Operate / Evidence / Knowledge / Govern / Trust) under uppercase labels. Links are 14px/600 in muted ink with a surface-2 hover. The active link gets a 10% blue wash, blue text and a blue icon.
- **Top bar:** 88% white with a 14px blur; brand wordmark on a navy badge; pill search trigger with a keyboard hint; status pills; language select; theme toggle; user menu.
- **Landing header:** fixed, 78% navy with a 14px blur and a hairline bottom. Text links in muted night text plus a white pill "Sign in". The links hide below 760px.

### Signals Strip (signature, workbench)
A single white bar of 5 hairline-divided cells. Each cell has a state dot, a small label and a bold tabular value, and links to its source. A pending dot breathes at 1.4s.

### Particle Mark and Spine (signature, landing)
Retained particle infrastructure assembles the neutral LRA mark; reduced motion, Save-Data or unavailable WebGL uses the still mark. Section markers and source convergence describe planned legal relationships. Original industrial imagery/benchmarks remain archive material, not active legal-product proof.

### Atmosphere and Glass (signature, landing)
One fixed raw-WebGL backdrop runs from the hero to the footer (`atmosphere.js`). It is domain-warped smoke in navy, blue and a cold indigo undertone, softly lit where the cursor is. Cursor movement pushes the smoke in the direction of travel and briefly quickens it; scroll lifts it at a slower rate than the page. No beams or laser lines: they read as overstated and were removed at the owner's request. It renders at half resolution, pauses when the tab is hidden, draws a single still frame under reduced motion, and falls back to the CSS gradient under Save-Data or when WebGL is unavailable. Story panels (`[data-glass]`) are frosted glass over it: 16px backdrop blur, a top-lit sheen, an inset highlight edge and a cyan under-glow. On fine pointers they tilt toward the cursor (8° at most, less for large panels), drift up to 6px after it, and light the face and the edge nearest to it. Section headlines resolve word by word out of a blur.

### Auth Instrument (signature, auth)
Active auth uses the neutral static development background, with original decorative media/crossfade helpers retained but not selected. The top bar reports process health only, not model/locality/legal readiness. Forms keep native controls, accessibility, server-reported capability gating and existing focus/keyboard behavior.

### Motion
Motion is exponential (`cubic-bezier(0.16, 1, 0.3, 1)`) and always starts from visible content. Charts draw their lines in 1.2s and grow bars with a 28ms stagger. Page changes cross-fade only the main pane (140ms out, 320ms in). Everything is gated by `prefers-reduced-motion`.

## Do's and Don'ts

### Do:
- **Do** pick the register by surface: `data-theme="dark"` for landing and auth, the light default for everything under `/app`.
- **Do** keep night-side cyan to lines, strokes, focus and one highlighted phrase. Primary actions there are Signal White pills.
- **Do** use Workbench Blue as the only day-side action and selection colour, and reserve green, amber and red for verified, review and error.
- **Do** set every live workbench number in tabular numerals next to a plain-language unit.
- **Do** give every empty, loading, planned or stale state a visible form: dashed for planned or empty, a breathing dot for pending, grey for stale.
- **Do** use dashed strokes only for provisional, hypothetical or boundary meaning.
- **Do** ship a still fallback for every WebGL or video surface under reduced motion, Save-Data or no WebGL.

### Don't:
- **Don't** bring Archivo, glow, WebGL, footage or navy fields into the `/app` workbench.
- **Don't** fill buttons or large areas with Instrument Cyan.
- **Don't** use green for anything that is not verified or healthy.
- **Don't** use hard offset shadows in either register.
- **Don't** alter archived industrial artwork or present it as legal branding. Use the neutral development SVGs, with a navy badge on light surfaces; permanent brand assets need separate approval.
- **Don't** put a small uppercase label above a heading as a kicker. Uppercase labels name the content they sit on (nav groups, metrics, evidence types).
